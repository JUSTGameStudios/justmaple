# Commit and Push Changes

Commit all current changes and push to the remote repository:

1. Check git status to see what files have been modified
2. Check recent commit history to understand commit message style
3. Stage all changes with git add
4. Create a descriptive commit message that:
   - Summarizes the nature of changes (feature, fix, refactor, etc.)
   - Focuses on the "why" rather than just the "what"
   - Is concise but informative (1-2 sentences)
5. Commit the changes with the generated message
6. Push the changes to the remote repository
7. Confirm the push was successful

The commit message should follow this format:
```
Brief description of changes

Optional longer description if needed for context.
```
